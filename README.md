# Welcome Contoso BI - Analytics Demo Assets for Dynamics 365 sellers.

These assets are designed to help demonstrate the power of using Power BI analytics and reporting to expose the value of the data in a Dynamics 365 CE implementation. The sample data is sourced from Excel (originally exported from Dynamics) as a way of making them easy to transport from one demo environment to another and to allow for customization for different demo scenarios.
